Note: When Ansible is already installed via system packages on the control machine, other python packages installed via `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt` will go to a different directory tree (e.g. `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages` on Ubuntu) from Ansible's (e.g. `/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible` still on Ubuntu).
